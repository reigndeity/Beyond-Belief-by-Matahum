  archiveDescription: "The Taawi is no spirit of grace but a creature of hunger and
    might. Towering and broad, with strength said to rival ten men, it stalks the
    wild edges of settlements in search of prey. Despite its great bulk, the Taawi
    moves with unsettling speed \u2014 its roars echoing through the trees before
    the ground itself seems to tremble. Legends claim it devours all it captures,
    save for the eyes, which its body cannot stomach. Villagers once lit watchfires
    at night and carved boundary charms to keep it at bay, for no weapon forged by
    ordinary hands could bring it down.\r\n\r\nNature: Malevolent ogre-like creature
    of Maranao origin."
