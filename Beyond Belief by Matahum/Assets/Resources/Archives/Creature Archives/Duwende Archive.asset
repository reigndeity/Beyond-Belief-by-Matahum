  archiveDescription: "Small but proud, the Duwende are earthbound beings that dwell
    beneath mounds, roots, and stones. Known for their mischief and temper, they
    protect their territory fiercely. Offer them respect - a polite \u2018tabi-tabi
    po\u2019 before crossing their home - and they may grant small favors. Disrespect
    them, however, and illness or misfortune may follow. Many healers attribute sudden
    swelling or paralysis to the Duwende\u2019s unseen touch.\r\n\r\nNature: Territorial
    earth spirits; easily angered."
