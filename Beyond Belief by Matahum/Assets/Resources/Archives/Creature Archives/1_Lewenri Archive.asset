  archiveDescription: 'Mysterious and seldom seen, the Lewenri are said to be remnants
    of souls too burdened to ascend. Neither ghost nor god, they drift between realms
    - their presence marked by still air and pale, glimmering light. It is believed
    that they draw vitality from emotion, appearing to those weighed by sorrow. To
    encounter one is both a warning and a blessing: grief may fade, but a part of
    you will follow them into the mist.



    Nature: Melancholic spirit of transition.'
