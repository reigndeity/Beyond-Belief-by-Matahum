  archiveDescription: 'Feared for their mastery of curses, the Mangkukulam are practitioners
    of dark sorcery who channel the fires of wrath. Their power is fueled not by
    malice alone, but by purpose - vengeance, grief, or balance long denied. They
    can summon illness, cause misfortune, or ignite flames from afar using effigies
    or enchanted oils. Despite their fearsome reputation, some use their craft to
    punish evil and restore justice where the law cannot reach.

    

    Nature:
    Human sorcerer; wielder of curse-fire.'
