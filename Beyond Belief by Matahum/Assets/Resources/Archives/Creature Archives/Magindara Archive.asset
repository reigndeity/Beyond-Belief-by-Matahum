  archiveDescription: 'The Magindara are oceanic spirits with voices as beautiful
    as the tides are cruel. They dwell along coral reefs and coastal caves, their
    songs weaving illusions to lure sailors beneath the waves. Yet not all are wicked
    - some sing only to mourn the lost or to warn of coming storms. Ancient stories
    tell of Magindara who fell in love with mortals, their tears said to form the
    pearls found along the western isles.

    

    Nature: Ambivalent water spirit;
    both temptress and protector.'
