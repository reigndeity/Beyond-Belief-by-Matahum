  archiveDescription: "The Albularyo is the village\u2019s lifeline - a healer who
    bridges the seen and unseen. Trained in herbs, chants, and sacred oils, they
    treat both physical and spiritual ailments. Some draw their gift from divine
    faith; others through inherited pacts with nature spirits. In every village,
    an Albularyo is more than a doctor - they are judge, priest, and protector, wielding
    wisdom older than medicine itself.\r\n\r\nNature: Human healer and spiritual
    mediator."
