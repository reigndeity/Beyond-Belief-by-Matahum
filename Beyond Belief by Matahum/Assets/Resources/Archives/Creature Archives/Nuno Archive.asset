  archiveDescription: 'An ancient guardian of the land, the Nuno sa Punso is the
    spirit of the mound - small, wrinkled, and immensely powerful. They act as stewards
    of the earth, punishing those who trample upon their homes without respect. Illness,
    swelling, or unexplainable pain are said to be their curses. However, those who
    bow and greet them with sincerity may receive blessings of fertility, protection,
    and fortune. Every mound is a throne, and every Nuno a king in miniature.



    Nature:
    Territorial earth guardian.'
