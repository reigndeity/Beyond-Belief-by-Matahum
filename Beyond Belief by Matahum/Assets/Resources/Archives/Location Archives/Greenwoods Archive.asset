  archiveDescription: A rich area down south. The area is filled with vegetation
    scattered around. The soil seems to be richer ompared to the other areas as the
    trees are greener, and the flowers are more vibrant. It would've been great if
    only there weren't so many duwende. Alas, I must keep my distance to keep myselfout
    of trouble.
