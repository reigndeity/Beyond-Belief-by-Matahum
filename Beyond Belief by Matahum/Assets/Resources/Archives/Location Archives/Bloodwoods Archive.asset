  archiveDescription: A semi-wooded area up north. There's much trees and greenery
    here, and seems like a very lovely area. But somehow, I cant shake the feeling
    that I am being watched. Maybe it's the wrecked and abandoned houses scattered
    around the area that's giving me ideas. Needless to say, I should keep my guard
    up here.
