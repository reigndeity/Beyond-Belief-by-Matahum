  archiveDescription: A quiet area past the lake. It is serene and cool here. It
    seems like a great place to go on picnics and siestas, but one has to be careful
    of the water as Magindara are present, ready to drown those who are lured in
    by their song. But despite the risks present, it is a lovely place to be in.
