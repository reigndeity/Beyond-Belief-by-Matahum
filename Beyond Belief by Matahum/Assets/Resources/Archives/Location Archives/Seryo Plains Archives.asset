  archiveDescription: A clearing to the east. This area smells of the sea, probably
    because of the salt scattered around the area. Weird mounds are scattered all
    around and these duwende seem to dislike it when I go near theirs. One mound
    stands out, it is larger, and has more things growing on it. This makes me very
    curious.
