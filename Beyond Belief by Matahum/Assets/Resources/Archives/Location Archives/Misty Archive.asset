  archiveDescription: A very moist and humid region. Unique trees called mangroves
    grow in the area. But for trees that require large amounts of water to survive
    and propagate, the area seems to be lacking in water. The seems thick and generally
    displeasing, yet there is a house here. Maybe its not that bad of a place as
    I think.
