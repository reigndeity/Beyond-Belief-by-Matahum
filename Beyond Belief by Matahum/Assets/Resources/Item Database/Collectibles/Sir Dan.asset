  description: "A familiar brown leather bag, aged by years of guidance and late-night
    talks. Once feared as the mark of a strict mentor, it\u2019s now remembered as
    a symbol of care and wisdom. Those who knew its owner say he carried not just
    notes and plans, but the weight of every student he helped along the way. The
    bag\u2019s worn strap feels lighter \u2014 almost as if it still walks beside
    you."
