  description: "Adlao is the son of Dagat and Paros. He joined Daga\u2019s rebellion
    and died, and his body became the sun.\nIn another myth, Adlao survived and fought
    in a great battle. During this fight, he cut off one of Bulan\u2019s arms and
    struck his eyes. The severed arm was flattened and became part of the earth,
    while Bulan\u2019s tears formed the rivers and seas."
