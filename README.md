# Game Overview
Beyond Belief is an open-world RPG that brings Philippine mythology to life through immersive storytelling and exploration. Players take on the role of Layag, a defiant teen trapped in the spirit world, journeying through folklore-inspired realms filled with mythical beings and moral choices. Blending action and narrative, the game both entertains and preserves the rich heritage and biodiversity of the Philippines.
