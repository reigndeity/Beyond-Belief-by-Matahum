# Game Overview
Beyond Belief is an open-world RPG that brings Philippine mythology to life through immersive storytelling and exploration. Players take on the role of Layag, a defiant teen trapped in the spirit world, journeying through folklore-inspired realms filled with mythical beings and moral choices. Blending action and narrative, the game both entertains and preserves the rich heritage and biodiversity of the Philippines.

This thesis capstone serves as a milestone of what I’m capable of today. It was built for academic requirements rather than long-term release, but it reflects the level of effort, creativity, and technical skill I can bring to a project. And as I continue learning, I know I’ll be able to produce even better, more polished work.
